1. Select a model and enter a post to detoxify. The PCTS model additionally requires information about the parent post. You may select a pre-defined example post from the dropdown menu or enter your own
- `ChatGPT`: Prompts chatgpt to detoxify the post directly.
- `PCTS`: Constructs a prompt consisting of the parent post, summaries, and desired toxicity levels to detoxify the post using a fine-tuned `T5-Large` model.
- `Comparison`: Displays both outputs side-by-side.
2. Select an example or enter your own to the right

While American women have personally suffered the repercussions of these assholes for decades. No. I truly don‚Äôt give a rats ass if it hasn‚Äôt been done before. These antichoice governors knowingly get into office, to constantly attempt to break federal law. If any normal citizen tried that,  they would be automatically thrown in jail. Im tired of placating these arrogant, antichoice, autocratic criminal assholes. They break law, under false guise of leading their state. And knowingly break their oaths to the us govt. The president or scotus needs to step the f up and say, enough. It‚Äôs gone on long enough, and yet nobody, not a single goddamned legitimate federal leader, will call them to account or take them to task for constantly attempting to break federal law. It‚Äôs fucking outrageous. I don‚Äôt give a shit how they personally feel about abortion. Their oath is to protect and uphold the laws of the United States. Instead of constantly trying to invalidate them. If they can‚Äôt do their actual job, then get out of office. There is no actual conversation about what happens, when state leaders are knowingly elected, that intentionally and constantly make a mockery of actual us and American federal law, rights, and liberties. None. And federal leaders refuse to acknowledge the outright, illegal proceedings against American women‚Äôs rights that have been occurring for fucking  fifty years. Someone has to fucking say it. When are actual federal leaders going to?",
